# Proffy - Remastered

### Brainstorm
Here are some ideas to improve the project.

1) Use a credit system to buy classes. Or you can give classes and get credits to buy other classes.

2) Rating system for teachers and students. This way, you can see the best teachers and students and rewards them with a badge and credits.

3) Use a chat system to talk to the teacher and the student. This way, you can talk to the teacher and the student before the class.
